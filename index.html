        <p> I currently work in the digital printing field working with graphics software and operating and maintaining digital printing machines which I thoroughly enjoy. In the last few years I have felt somewhat stuck in a rut with my job and I'm hoping to make a positive change in my career and life in general. I am here to learn about web development and hoping learn enough about this to get a better job or actually have a career. Apart from spending much of my time at work I also enjoy playing tennis, cycling, cooking, hiking, nature & spending time with my partner & my dog.  <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a></p>
